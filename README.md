# What is this?
This is the base of a framework to link wordpress users to discord users.


# How is the integration with the site possible?
There are plugins that extend the usability of this framework.

There are some plugins that are wrappers around other, website-only, plugins. They can basically bring shopify and other stuff to discord.

NOTE: The discord bot needs to be able to handle all those extra plugins, you may also need more than one bots or users.


NOTE2: The discord bot is completely isolated from the website, it only uses the API that the plugins provides.
